    "In the pytorch implementation, the loss decreases more steadily and does not drop as sharply in the first few iterations. It has more controlled descent but still reaches a low loss relatively quickly. The final loss is 0.0041, which shows strong convergence. This might be due to better numerical handling whihc is done by pytorch automaticaly.. Or automatic differentiation. PyTorch autograd computes gradients more efficiently and prevents errors compared to manual implementation where errors might occur. Manual implementation has a sharp initial drop, likely due to a high learning rate without momentum. PyTorch is more robust and generalizes better"
